.Nd GitHub notifications in system tray
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
periodically retrievs GitHub notifications and displays them in a drop menu
attached to its system tray icon.
Clicking on notification opens corresponding page on GitHub; notification is
marked as read.
.Pp
The icon indicates whether there are unread notifications.
If unread notifications are available a popup menu will contain a
.Cm Mark all read
command and commands for individual discussion threads.
The popup menu always contains an
.Cm Exit
command, which is the preferred way of exiting application.
.Pp
Balloon tooltip for system tray icon shows the time of the last connection to
GitHub.
Depending on system tray implementation, balloon tooltips may not be shown.
.Pp
.Nm
needs a valid GitHub personal access token for its operation, and it is user's
responsibility to provide one.
The token may be acquired from GutHub settings page
.Dq Personal access tokens
which is located at
.Lk https://github.com/settings/tokens .
The only OAuth scope
.Nm
needs for its operation is
.Dq notifications .
It is highly recommended to use a dedicated token with no extra scopes in order
to prevent unexpected consequences.
See
.Sx SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
section for details.
